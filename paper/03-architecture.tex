\section{Architecture}

A description of the design decisions your system makes and how it works.  This
is high/medium level along with \emph{some} details, but not the nitty-gritty
implementation details.  In other words, this should tell us how your system
works, but not that you built it on Linux version 3.X with machines that run at
Y GHz, etc.  Save that stuff for the implementation section.
